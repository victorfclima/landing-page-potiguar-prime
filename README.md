# Landing Page - Potiguar Prime
This is a landing page for a friend's business (Shrimp Farm). I developed this LP as a way to put in practice what I'm learning, with a real situation. I hope that can help someone in anyway. 

# What did I use?
HTML 5;<br>
CSS 3;<br>
Javascript;<br>
Bootstrap 4;<br>
jQuery;<br>
PHP (just for sending form through e-mail);<br>

# What are the features?
Responsible design;<br>
Flexbox Layout;<br>
Functional Forms;<br>
Deeplinking;<br>
Cool stuff from Bootstrap and jQuery;

# That was my first professional job as a Front End Dev. Hope you enjoy it!
